Hi there! I'm Ziang Tong, and I'm a senior majoring in computer science and applied math at the [University of Notre Dame](https://nd.edu). After graduation, I anticipate to pursue a Masters degree in computer science.

My passion lies between **computer graphics** and **high-performance systems**. Currently, I'm working on a project in neural representation of scenes, view interpolation, and novel view synthesis.
