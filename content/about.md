I'm currently in my senior year at the University of Notre Dame, on the track towards a B.S. in computer science with supplementary major in applied computational math and statistics (ACMS).

In school, I'm part of the SaNDwich lab in human-computer interaction, directed by [Dr. Toby Jia-jun Li](https://toby.li/) and the Visualization lab in computer graphics and scientific visualization, directed by [Dr. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/).

In my spare time, I am a video game developer, landscape photographer, and EDM producer. Also a frenetic fan of nature and hiking, I'm on the mission of hiking all the 63 national parks in the United States.
