      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my senior year at the University of Notre Dame, on the track towards a B.S. in computer science with supplementary major in applied computational math and statistics (ACMS).
In school, I&amp;rsquo;m part of the SaNDwich lab in human-computer interaction, directed by Dr. Toby Jia-jun Li and the Visualization lab in computer graphics and scientific visualization, directed by Dr. Chaoli Wang.
In my spare time, I am a video game developer, landscape photographer, and EDM producer.</description>
